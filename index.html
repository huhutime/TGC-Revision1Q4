      Bread is a staple food prepared from a dough of flour and water, usually
      by baking. There are more than 100 types of bread available around the
      globe. Most bread can be categorized into sub-types, such as quick breads,
      flatbread, and yeast bread. In many countries, commercial bread often
      contains additives to improve flavor, texture, color, shelf life,
      nutrition, and ease of production.
